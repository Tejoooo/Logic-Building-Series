## 🧩 What is Low-Level Design?

Low-Level Design (LLD) focuses on **detailed class structures**, **interactions**, and **internal component architecture**.

While HLD tells *what* the system contains,  
LLD tells *how* each component works internally.

LLD includes:
- Class diagrams  
- Sequence diagrams  
- Interfaces  
- Inheritance & composition  
- Object modeling  
- Applying design patterns  

---

## ⭐ Why LLD Is Important
- Shows your ability to convert requirements → code-ready structure  
- Ensures scalable and maintainable software  
- Highly tested in companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Uber, Swiggy, Atlassian
