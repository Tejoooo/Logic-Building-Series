# Trees in Data Structures & Algorithms

## What are Trees?
A **tree** is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, with a single node as the root and zero or more child nodes. Trees are widely used in DSA for representing hierarchical relationships.

## Key Topics to Learn

- **Tree Terminology**: Node, Root, Leaf, Parent, Child, Sibling, Height, Depth, Subtree, etc.
- **Types of Trees**:
    - Binary Tree
    - Binary Search Tree (BST)
    - AVL Tree
    - Red-Black Tree
    - Segment Tree
    - Trie
    - N-ary Tree
    - Heap (Min/Max)
- **Tree Traversal Techniques**:
    - Preorder (Root-Left-Right)
    - Inorder (Left-Root-Right)
    - Postorder (Left-Right-Root)
    - Level Order (Breadth-First)
- **Common Operations**:
    - Insertion
    - Deletion
    - Searching
    - Balancing

## Traversal Techniques

### 1. Preorder Traversal
Visit root, traverse left subtree, traverse right subtree.

### 2. Inorder Traversal
Traverse left subtree, visit root, traverse right subtree.

### 3. Postorder Traversal
Traverse left subtree, traverse right subtree, visit root.

### 4. Level Order Traversal
Visit nodes level by level (BFS).
