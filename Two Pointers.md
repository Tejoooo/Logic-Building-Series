# üß† Two Pointers Problem List (LeetCode + GeeksforGeeks)

## üîπ What is the Two Pointers Technique?

The **Two Pointers** technique is a common and efficient method used to solve problems involving **arrays**, **strings**, or **linked lists**.  
It works by maintaining two indices (pointers) that move through the data structure in a strategic way to achieve the goal ‚Äî such as finding pairs, reversing data, or detecting patterns.

## ‚öôÔ∏è When to Use Two Pointers

You can usually identify Two Pointer problems when:

1. You need to **find pairs or triplets** that satisfy a condition (like sum = target).  
2. You need to **move elements** or **rearrange** them efficiently (like moving zeros to the end).  
3. You need to **compare** or **merge** two sorted arrays or linked lists.  
4. You‚Äôre asked to **check for palindromes** or **reverse** sequences.  
5. You need to **detect loops** or **find middle elements** in a linked list.

## üß© How to Approach Two Pointer Problems

1. **Identify the pattern**  
   ‚Üí Is it sorted? Are we looking for a pair/triplet/specific condition?  

2. **Choose the pointer movement strategy**  
   - **Same direction**: Both pointers start together and move forward (e.g., removing duplicates).  
   - **Opposite direction**: Pointers start from both ends (e.g., 3Sum, two-sum in sorted array).  
   - **Different speeds**: One fast and one slow pointer (e.g., finding cycle in a linked list).  

3. **Update pointers based on condition**  
   - Move left or right pointer depending on whether the condition is met.  
   - Adjust the loop until you find or rule out the solution.

4. **Think in terms of optimization**  
   ‚Üí Two pointers often replace nested loops to bring **O(n¬≤)** down to **O(n)**.
