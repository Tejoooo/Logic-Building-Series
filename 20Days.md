---

## üîπ Week 1: Foundations & Basics
**Goal:** Learn syntax, writing small programs, and basic problem-solving.  
(Pick a beginner-friendly language like Python, C++, or Java. Example assumes Python.)

- **Day 1:**  
  - Install tools (VS Code / PyCharm / Online IDE).  
  - Learn variables, data types, input/output.  
  - Practice: Print name, sum of two numbers, simple calculator.

- **Day 2:**  
  - Conditionals (`if/else`).  
  - Practice: Odd/even, largest of 3 numbers, grade calculator.

- **Day 3:**  
  - Loops (`for`, `while`).  
  - Practice: Multiplication table, sum of digits, factorial.

- **Day 4:**  
  - Strings.  
  - Practice: Palindrome check, reverse a string, count vowels.

- **Day 5:**  
  - Lists/Arrays.  
  - Practice: Find max/min, sum of list, remove duplicates.

- **Day 6:**  
  - Functions.  
  - Practice: Prime checker, Fibonacci.

- **Day 7:**  
  - Revision + small problems (LeetCode Easy).  
  - Examples:  
    - Two Sum (#1)  
    - Palindrome Number (#9)  
    - FizzBuzz (#412)

## üîπ Week 2: Core Problem-Solving
**Goal:** Apply loops, conditionals, and arrays in real problems.

- **Day 8:**  
  - Arrays.  
  - Practice: Move zeros to end, rotate array, merge sorted arrays.

- **Day 9:**  
  - Hashing & frequency count (dictionaries in Python).  
  - Practice: Majority element, first unique character.

- **Day 10:**  
  - Sorting basics (bubble, selection, insertion).  
  - Practice: Sort numbers, sort strings by length.

- **Day 11:**  
  - Binary search basics.  
  - Practice: Search in sorted array, first/last occurrence.

- **Day 12:**  
  - Recursion intro.  
  - Practice: Factorial, Fibonacci, sum of array recursively.

- **Day 13:**  
  - Pattern printing (triangle, pyramid).  
  - Helps to build logic with loops.

- **Day 14:**  
  - Revision + easy LeetCode problems.

## üîπ Week 3: Data Structures
**Goal:** Understand how data is stored & manipulated.

- **Day 15:**  
  - Stacks (using list).  
  - Practice: Balanced parentheses, reverse a string.

- **Day 16:**  
  - Queues (using `collections.deque`).  
  - Practice: Circular queue simulation, first non-repeating character.

- **Day 17:**  
  - Linked List basics.  
  - Practice: Insert, delete, reverse linked list.

- **Day 18:**  
  - Trees (basic traversal).  
  - Practice: Inorder, preorder, postorder traversal.

- **Day 19:**  
  - Graph basics.  
  - Practice: BFS, DFS on small graphs.

- **Day 20:**  
  - Revision of all topics.  
  - Solve a mix of problems from arrays, strings, recursion, and data structures.
