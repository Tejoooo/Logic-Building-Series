# 🧠 7-Day Beginner-Friendly LeetCode Plan

Welcome! This is a **beginner-friendly roadmap** to help you get started with solving **LeetCode Easy** problems over 7 days. It includes notes and problem links for each day. You only need 1.5 to 2 hours a day!

---

## ✅ Goals:
- Understand basic Data Structures & Algorithms
- Solve real LeetCode problems confidently
- Build consistency with a structured 1-week plan

---

## 📅 Day 1: Arrays — Your First Step

### 📝 Notes:
- An array is a collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations.
- Index starts from `0`.
- Common operations: Traverse, Search, Insert, Delete

### 🔗 Problems:
- [Running Sum of 1d Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/)
- [Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)
- [Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)

---

## 📅 Day 2: Strings — Learn the Basics

### 📝 Notes:
- A string is a sequence of characters (like `"hello"`).
- Strings are immutable in most languages.
- Operations: Traverse, Compare, Reverse, Transform

### 🔗 Problems:
- [Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)
- [Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)
- [To Lower Case](https://leetcode.com/problems/to-lower-case/)

---

## 📅 Day 3: HashMaps — Count & Check

### 📝 Notes:
- HashMap (dictionary) stores key-value pairs.
- Great for counting frequencies, checking duplicates.
- O(1) average lookup time.

### 🔗 Problems:
- [Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/)
- [Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/)
- [First Unique Character in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/)

---

## 📅 Day 4: Two Pointers — Left and Right Magic

### 📝 Notes:
- Use two pointers (`left`, `right`) to scan array/string.
- Used to solve problems efficiently by avoiding extra loops.
- Good for sorted arrays and palindrome checks.

### 🔗 Problems:
- [Merge Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/)
- [Remove Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/)
- [Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)

---

## 📅 Day 5: Recursion — Think Like a Function

### 📝 Notes:
- A function that calls itself.
- Base Case: When to stop.
- Recursive Case: Problem keeps reducing.

### 🔗 Problems:
- [Fibonacci Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/)
- [Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)
- [Power of Two](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-two/)

---

## 📅 Day 6: Trees — Don’t Worry, Just Basics

### 📝 Notes:
- A Binary Tree node has at most two children (left & right).
- Recursion is often used to traverse trees (DFS).
- Use visual diagrams to understand parent-child structure.

### 🔗 Problems:
- [Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/)
- [Invert Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/)
- [Same Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/)

---

## 📅 Day 7: Review & Mixed Practice

### 🎯 Tasks:
- Review all notes and key learnings.
- Re-attempt 2 problems you previously found hard.
- Try 3 bonus problems below.

### 🔗 Bonus Problems:
- [Majority Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/)
- [Missing Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/)
- [Excel Sheet Column Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/excel-sheet-column-number/)

---

## 🛠️ Tips & Resources
- Read editorials if stuck more than 15 minutes.
- Track your problems in a Notion/Google Sheet.
- Watch YouTube: "LeetCode + [topic name] + beginner"
- Practice consistency — that's the key to improvement!
