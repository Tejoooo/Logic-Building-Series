# Sliding Window DSA Practice ‚Äì 20 Essential Problems

# Sliding Window Technique ü™ü

## üìò Overview
The Sliding Window technique is used to optimize problems that involve **subarrays or substrings** within an array or string.  
Instead of recomputing results for each possible subarray, we ‚Äúslide‚Äù a window across the data to reuse previous computations.

## üß© Types of Sliding Windows

### 1. **Fixed-size Sliding Window**
Used when the **window length `k`** is constant.

Example problems:
- Maximum sum of a subarray of size `k`
- Average of each subarray of size `k`

**Key idea:**  
Keep track of the current window sum (or other metric) and adjust when the window slides.

---

### 2. **Variable-size Sliding Window**
Used when we need to find a subarray that satisfies a **condition**, and the window can expand or shrink dynamically.

Example problems:
- Longest substring without repeating characters
- Smallest subarray with sum ‚â• target

**Key idea:**  
Use two pointers (`left`, `right`) to expand or contract the window based on constraints.

---

### 3. **Deque-based Sliding Window**
Used when we need to efficiently track **maximum/minimum** values within a window.

Example problems:
- Sliding Window Maximum
- First negative number in every window of size `k`

**Key idea:**  
Maintain a deque of elements in decreasing order of value (or increasing, depending on the problem).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps to Solve Sliding Window Problems

1. Identify if it‚Äôs a **subarray/substring** problem.  
2. Check if the **window size** is fixed or variable.  
3. Use a **running window** (sum, count, hash map, deque, etc.) to maintain state.  
4. Slide the window and **update the result** dynamically.

## üß† Common Patterns

| Type | Example Problem | Key Data Structures |
|------|------------------|--------------------|
| Fixed | Max sum of subarray size k | sum variable |
| Variable | Longest substring without repeating characters | hash map or set |
| Deque-based | Sliding window maximum | deque |
| Counting | Count anagrams in string | frequency map |

---

## üí° Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) ‚Äî Each element enters and leaves the window once.  
- **Space Complexity:** O(k) or O(1), depending on window data structures.

---

## üî• Tip
If the question involves **"subarray"**, **"substring"**, **"window of size k"**, or **"minimum/maximum length satisfying condition"**,  
then it‚Äôs most likely a **Sliding Window** problem!
